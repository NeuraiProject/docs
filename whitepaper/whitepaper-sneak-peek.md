### Abstract
Neurai is a platform designed to explore the convergence and interoperability of three disruptive technologies in the coming years: blockchain for information integrity and traceability, Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time, massive data generation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for data processing and decision-making. We introduce unique identifiers to ensure trust among different devices, utilize an internal messaging system for secure information transmission between users, add assets for real world goods traceability, enable decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) and employ Proof of Work (PoW) as a consensus mechanism.

###  1. Introduction
The technological revolution in recent years has led to a world where interconnectivity and digitalization are at the core of daily life, with billions of devices connected to Internet. Not only are there computers, servers, or mobile phones, but also vehicles, information panels, cameras, appliances, televisions, radios, drones, robots, etc. While more devices are connecting, improving various aspects of life, this revolution has also resulted in high service centralization in a few companies.

We propose a set of cryptographic tools, based on Satoshi's Bitcoin concept and extended by Ravencoin developers, to mitigate this centralization. These tools aim to achieve IoT device connectivity in a decentralized environment, safeguarded from attacks or blocks by centralized entities, and controlled solely by the device owners. Unique identifiers, encrypted messages between devices, assets for traceability, a decentralized DNS system, AI for IoT devices, and ongoing core improvements are among our proposals to avoid constant service concentration and create a personal and global ecosystem accessible from any geographical location without impediments.

###  2. Decentralization
Creating a decentralized system presents a range of technical, organizational and economic challenges, making it inherently complex. In a decentralized system, ensuring that all nodes have a coherent view of the global state is a non-trivial problem. Consensus algorithms like PoW solve this issue. As more nodes join the network, performance and efficiency do not scale linearly but do offer greater network protection by blocking any transaction attempts outside of the global consensus, thus allowing better connectivity from any access point.

We base our approach on Ravencoin's code to establish a set of tools for achieving this decentralization, detailed as follows:

- Enhanced Bitcoin code, adding more functionalities.
- ASIC-resistant and GPU-friendly PoW, preventing large mining farms.
- Integrated assets in the code and the main layer.
- Block time set to 1 minute.
- Block size set to 8 Mb.
- Bblock reward is more dynamic to adjust every 10 days.
- Custom assets for unique identifier services and traceability.

Running a node is straightforward, increases network decentralization, and allows rapid access to those who operate it, without relying on external machines or third-party services for transactions.

###  3. IoT

An IoT device is responsible for coordinated data collection from the environment, processing it and communicating it to other devices or systems via a network, usually the Internet. With the advent of artificial intelligence, decision-making can be optimized over non-adaptive systems.

This information generally uses centralized services that can be easily compromised. We develop a set of tools for secure information transfer through cryptographic systems managed solely by the owner, with connectivity from any location provided there is a connection to a service node.

For this connectivity, IoT devices connected to the blockchain network can do so in various ways:

#### 3.1 Simple Connectivity

- Unique identifier created by burning a certain amount of coins.
- Identifier sent to an address used by the IoT device.
- IoT device configures this identifier through a digital signature.
- A unique communication channel is established between the owner and the IoT device through this signature.
- Limited information is communicated via the blockchain node.
- External connections can be configured while maintaining encrypted communication through the identifier.
- The owner has full control over the identifier and can transfer, move, or delete it.

#### 3.2 Mesh Connectivity

- Multiple identifiers are created by burning a certain amount of coins.
- These identifiers are sent to multiple addresses used by the IoT devices.
- IoT devices configure these identifiers through digital signatures.
- A unique communication channel is established among the owner and the IoT devices through these signatures.
- Communication among different IoT devices is enabled through digital signatures.
- Limited information is communicated via the blockchain node. 
- External connections can be configured while maintaining encrypted communication through the identifiers.
- The owner has full control over the identifiers and can transfer, move, or delete them.
- Various communication protocols can be used.
